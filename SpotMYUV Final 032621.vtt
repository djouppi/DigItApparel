Spot My UV levels up your sun
protection with a simple spot check.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.622
Spot My UV tells you if
your sun screen is working

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:14.080
and when it's time to reapply.
Let's see how easy

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.505
it is to stay safe in the sun.
Each spot has a

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.880
tab so you can easily
apply without touching.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.508
Ensuring all day adhesion.
Simply hold the tab,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.218
and peel the spot from
the backing paper.

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:30.638
Apply to a sun exposed
area on your body.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:34.160
A good place is your upper arm.
Pull the application

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.843
tab and discard it,
and press the spot firmly to

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.440
your skin,
and apply your favourite sun screen

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.263
over the spot,
and liberally all over your entire body.

00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:45.520
Make sure to follow
the directions on your

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.909
favourite sun screen.
Most people don't use enough.

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.600
As you apply the
spot will turn clear

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240
indicating that your sun screen is working,
and helping to protect you from UV rays.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.936
Have fun in the sun.
The spot will gradually begin

00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:03.632
to turn people again indicating
that it's time to reapply.

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:05.788
Many factors affect
how often you'll

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.880
need to reapply including
the sun's strength,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.748
and your activities.
One spot will last all day

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.681
through sports, swimming,
and perspiration.

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:19.748
Spot My UV makes it fun to
spot exactly when your sun

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.800
screen wears off,
and when it's time to reapply.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.352
A few points: if the
dot isn't turning clear

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:30.452
your sun screen may not
be a high enough SPF.

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:33.704
Or it might have expired.
Or you may not have applied enough.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.329
It's sun safety made perfectly clear.
